        <h1>Why is WoT important?</h1>
        <p>The Web of Things Architecture is important because it make managing IoT devices easy. We have so many connected devices around us, it’s annoying to deal with different apps for each one. Switching between ten apps to control ten devices is irritating and uncomfortable. WoT solves this problem by creating a universal system that lets all these devices talk to each other seamlessly.</p>
        <p>One big problem with IoT is that there’s no single language that all devices use to communicate. Most IoT systems don’t work well together, which keeps devices stuck in their own little non compatible system. WoT solves this by using common web standards like HTTP to bring everything together. Which means devices from different brands can finally interact which makes IoT more easier for everyone.</p>
        <p>WoT also ensures devices share data in a way that actually makes sense. It’s not enough to just connect things to the internet they need to understand and respond to each other’s data. WoT makes that possible by making this the new normal of how devices interact. This makes using IoT easier, pushes innovation, and helps create a smarter, more connected world.</p>
